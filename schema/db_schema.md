### Participant IDs

A participant ID is provided by BGS to uniquely identify (1) Claimants (who may be Veterans) and (2) POA entities (which can be an organization or individual). Several tables refer to the participant ID by different names, depending on who they are referencing.

A participant ID for a **POA** is usually named `poa_participant_id`, for example in the DB tables: `appeals`, `appellant_substitutions`, `bgs_power_of_attorneys`, and `unrecognized_appellants`. Some exceptions are the `bgs_attorneys` and `organizations` tables, which simply use `participant_id`. Note: For the `organizations` table, only organizations with `type="Representative"` have a non-null `participant_id`.

A participant ID for a **claimant or veteran** goes by several names, such as `claimant_participant_id`, `veteran_participant_id`, and `substitute_participant_id`. The `claimants`, `veterans`, `people`, and `decision_issues` tables simply use `participant_id`.


## Semi-automated documentation
* Ever want to see the schema for a subset of tables? Paste excerpts from [`schema.rb`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/master/db/schema.rb) and "Import" into http://dbdiagram.io/, then move the boxes around to your liking. Example [diagram of Document-related tables](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5ed6793d39d18f5553002077) and more in [ticket #15510](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/issues/15510).
* Extending previous work on parent-child task type relationships (such as [this for the DR docket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/appeals-team/blob/master/Project%20Folders/Tasks/tasktrees/docs-DR/freq-parentchild.md)) and [playing with Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/yoomlam/notes/blob/master/python_notebook/connect_postgres.ipynb), here's an interactive graph showing [parent-child task type relationships for all task trees in prod](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yoomlam/notes/blob/master/python_notebook/ParentChildTaskTypeCounts.html) as of July 19, 2020.
