  Purpose of the
  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch
</h2>

<p>
  This branch (<a
    href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/tree/gh-pages"
    ><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code></a
  >) is used by GitHub Pages. This branch is not intended to be merged in the
  main branch. Not that it has a completely separate commit history from the
  main branch. For more info, see â€¦
</p>

<p>
  This branch has files for documentation. Some are automatically generated
  (e.g., by a GitHub Action); others are manually created.
</p>

<p>Why not wiki?</p>

<p>
  Anyone can commit to this branch without a peer-review, just like the Caseflow
  wiki page. Instead of committing directly to this branch, create a development
  branch and do a squash-merge when you are satisfied with the changes, just
  like what is done in the main branch.
