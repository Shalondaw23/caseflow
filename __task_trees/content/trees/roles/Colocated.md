# Colocated Description

The Colocated user role is any user of the Caseflow application performing the duties of a VSJ support staff in the Veteran appeals process (see [Colocated](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/98be94ace99a978a8c20249f6177e8aa5b5bbf0b/app/models/organizations/colocated.rb#L5)). Users with this role can complete various tasks in the appeals process to support the attorneys and judges with moving the appeal through its different phases. Users with this role can also have the [Hearings Users](Hearings_User.md) or [Intake Users](Intake_User.md) roles.

## Tasks

There are many different types of tasks that can be completed by Colocated users depending on where the case is in the appeals process. For more information on how tasks are created through the different phases, see [Tasks Overview](../tasks-overview.md).
