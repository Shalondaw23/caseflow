* This task is used to track all related CAVC subtasks for AMA Appeal Streams.
* If this task is still open, there is still more CAVC-specific work to be done of this appeal.
* This task should be a child of DistributionTask, and so it blocks distribution until all its children are closed.
* There are no actions available to any user for this task.
