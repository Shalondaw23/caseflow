For more info, see … . This branch has files for documentation. Some are automatically generated (e.g., Caseflow DB schema by a GitHub Action); others are manually created (e.g., Bat Team Remedies). The gh-pages branch is updated by a build-gh-pages GitHub Action that uses files from the main-gh-pages branch to generate html and asset files, which are pushed to the gh-pages branch. You should not modify the gh-pages branch directly. Any commit to the main-gh-pages branch will trigger the GitHub Action, which can be seen here. See Committing changes for how to make changes. ",
