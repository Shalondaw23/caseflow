# React Hook Form

[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) was released in 2019. It supports nearly all the same basic features as Formik, but focuses on performance and intuitive code.

It only supports hooks, which means that it can only be used in functional components. Class-based form components would need to be rewritten as functional components or abstracted so that the form is within a functional

```js
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import * as yup from 'yup';

const validationSchema = yup.object().shape({
  name: yup.string().required(),
  email: yup
    .string()
    .email()
    .required()
});

const { register, handleSubmit, errors } = useForm({ validationSchema });
const onSubmit = data => console.log(data);

return (
  <form noValidate onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
    <TextField
      ref={register}
      name="name"
      label="Name"
      required
      errorMessage={errors.name && errors.name.message}
    />
    <TextField
      ref={register}
      name="email"
      label="Email"
      required
      errorMessage={errors.email && errors.email.message}
    />

    <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
  </form>
);
```
